# Quoted

This project demonstrates the use of Angular to build a simple webapp. Here users can create quotes and have them voted on.

## Description

Quoted displays previously posted quotes and allows for the creation and deletion of quotes. Each quote can be upvoted or downvoted.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trucktar/quoted.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's parent directory

```sh
cd quoted/
```

3. Set up project environment and serve application

```sh
npm install
ng serve --open
```

## Usage

Use the displayed form to create a new quote. To vote on a specific quote, find the caret-up and caret-down icons. On click, the upvote or downvote count should increase. The trash icon provides a means to delete a quote.
